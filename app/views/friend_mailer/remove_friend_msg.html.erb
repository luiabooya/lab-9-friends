    <p><%= @friend.name %>,</p>

    <p>I had previously listed you as a friend, as embarrassing as it was.
	   However, I am reminded of the old Klingon proverb:<br />

      QaghmeylIj tIchID, yIyoH <br />
      <em>(Have the courage to admit your mistakes.)</em><br />
    </p>

    <p>Clearly it was a mistake to consider you a friend. I admit this error in judgment and hereby remove you from my friend list.</p>

    <p>Smell you never,</p>
