    Hi <%= @friend.nickname %>,

    I've just listed you as one of my friends. You're welcome!
	I am sure you are deeply honored, as you should be. 

    Remember the Klingon proverb regarding friends:

       may'Daq jaHDI' SuvwI' juppu'Daj lonbe' 
       (When a warrior goes to a battle, he does not abandon his friends.)

    The proverb is irrelevant.

    Much love,
	Luia
